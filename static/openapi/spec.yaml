      summary: Public Chat Message Stream
      description: |
        Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint that streams real-time chat messages for the authenticated streamer's primary channel.

        This public endpoint is secured with the channel API key (provide it in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <API_KEY>`).

        **Access requirement:** the streamer must have an active Flex, Unlimited, or Ultimate subscription.

        ## Payload
        Each `message` event contains:
        - `username` – Author of the chat message (viewer, streamer, or AI)
        - `content` – Message text
        - `role` – One of `Mod`, `VIP`, `AI`, `Viewer`, `Streamer`
        - `isSub` – Whether the chatter is a current subscriber
        - `sentDateTime` – UTC timestamp

        A periodic SSE `:ping` comment is sent every 30 seconds to keep the connection alive.
